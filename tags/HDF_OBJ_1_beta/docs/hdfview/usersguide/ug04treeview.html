<h1>
Chapter 4: The Tree Viewer</h1>
Every HDF object appears in at least one group. A set of objects can be
stored together in a group. You can use the group object API functions
to create and manipulate the groups. With the groups, you can organize
the data objects in an HDF file.

<p>Since objects can have names in more than one group, the set of all
objects in an HDF file is a directed graph. It is difficult to manipulate
and browse the graph on a 2D virtual screen. Instead of showing the directed
graph of the HDF file structure, HDFView displays HDF objects in an conventional
structure of a tree of "folders"; breaking the "loops" in the graph when
necessary. The tree viewer of HDFView provides users an easy way to browse
and manage HDF data objects in an HDF file.

<h2>
4.1 Tree Viewer</h2>
Upon opening an HDF file, HDFView displays the tree structure of the HDF
file in the tree viewer (panel), which is at the left of the HDFView. Every
HDF file has exact one root group that is created when the file is created.
The root group is added to the root of the tree. When two or more files are
open, the root groups of the files are listed at the root the tree view. 

<p>Groups are presented as folders in the tree viewer. Opening and closing
folders, you can browse the individual HDF objects in the HDF file. Datasets,
images and tables are leaf objects in the tree. Clicking a leaf object,
you see the content of the object displayed in the data/document window
on the right of the HDFView. Figure 4.1 illustrates that an HDF4 file, annras.hdf,
and an HDF5 file, hdf5_test.h5, are currently open by the HDFView.

<p>
To select an object in the tree, point mouse on the object and click once on the
object. You can open the data content of the selected data object from menu bar
or the popup menu. 

<p>The popup menu appears by clicking the right mouse button on the object
in the tree view. When a command is selected from the popup menu, the command
action will be taken on the object clicked.

<p>The object menu in the HDFView menu bar contains the same commands in the
popup menu.

<h2>
<a NAME="ug04data"></a>4.2 Data Content</h2>
The Tree View allows the user to navigate the structure of the HDF file,
to select individual objects, and to view the content of the selected object.

<p>
You can open a data object in the tree by a double-mouse-click or selecting open
command from menu bar or popup menu. By default, data content is displayed as 
an image, a table or text based on its datatype.

<p>
Using "Open As", you can select a subset of dataset to display or change the
default display options. For example, you can display the data values an image
in spreadsheet, or show a scalar dataset as an image. For multi-dimension dataset,
you use the display option window to select three dimensions to display.

<h2>
<a NAME="ug04metadata"></a>4.3 Metadata and Attributes</h2>

The metadata dialog appears by clicking the object (icon) in the tree with
the right button or select the "Properties" command from the "Object"
menu. The HDF metadata display contains two tabbed panes, showing the
general metadata and the user defined attributes.

<p>General metadata includes the name, type, path of the data object.

<p>For groups, general metadata also includes the name, type, size of all
the members of the group. Figure 4.5 shows an example of the general information 
of group.

<br><b>Figure 4.5 General Properties of HDF group.</b></center>


<p>For a dataset (or image), the general metadata includes the dataspace
information (rank, current and maximum size of each dimensions), datatype
information (type, size, order). 
Figure 4.6 shows an example of the metadata for a dataset.

<p>
To see the attributes of an object, you click the "Attribute" tab at
the Object Property Window. The name, type, size and value of all attributes
of the slected object are displayed in a table. Figure 4.7 shows and example
of the attribute display.
