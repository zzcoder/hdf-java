<h2>
What it is</h2>
The <b>HDF Object Package</b> is a Java package which implement HDF4 and
HDF5 data objects in an object-oriented form. The HDF Java Object Package
provides a common standard Java API to access both HDF4 and HDF5 files.
<p>The HDF Object Package is <b>NOT</b> a "wrapper" for the native HDF
libraries; The HDF4 and HDF5 wrappers are separate HDF Java products. For
details of the HDF4 and HDF5 native interfaces, read <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">NCSA
Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a> and
<a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">NCSA
Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>. The HDF Object Package wraps these
interfaces with a higher level object model.
<p>The HDF Object Package, <i>ncsa.hdf.object</i>, provides classes that
reflect fundamental conceptual to design of HDF objects. Objects
of HDF5 (group and dataset) and HDF4 (group, multi-dimension array, raster
image, vdata and annotation) are presented as Java classes.
<p>The HDF object package has two major goals. First, it simplifies the
process of reading information from or writing data to file because the
details of accessing to the HDF library are encapsulated into respective
classes. For example, it may take over ten library calls to get an image
from HDF5 file while the image object provides a single convenient call
to achieve the same task.
<p>Second, HDF4 and HDF5 objects are inherited from the same common object
and interface. Applications can use of the HDF Object Package to access
objects from either HDF4 or HDF5 in a uniform way, without accessing the
libraries directly.
<br>
<h2>
The class hierarchy</h2>
The HDF Object Package implements an abstract data model, and the objects
of the HDF4 and HDF5 data models are represented as instances of the abstract
objects. The abstract class <b>HObject</b> has two fundamental abstract
classes are <b>Group</b> and <b>Dataset</b>, and all HDF5 and HDF4 objects
are a sub-type of one of these abstract classes.
<p>Figure 1 shows the class hierarchy of the HDF Object Package. <i>{Peter
-- the dependency to the HDF Library Package is not identical to my diagram
below. We need to decide on a common way to show it in UML.}</i>
<p>The classes are explained in "<a href="design.html">Design of the HDF
object package</a>", and the Java classes are documented in <a href="javadocs/index.html">the
Javadocs</a>.

<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">How to use it</h2>
The HDF Object Package is used by Java applications to access HDF4 and
HDF5 files without directly calling the HDF4 and HDF5 library APIs. Library
calls are encapsulated into respective classes. The HDF Object Package
requires the
<a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">The Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a>
and
<a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">The Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>.
Figure 2 shows the relationship of the packages.

<p><b>Figure 2. The Software packages</b></center>

<p>Use of the HDF Object Package is explained in "<a href="use.html">How
to Use It</a>".
<h2>
Limitations</h2>
The current version of the HDF Object Package has the following limitations:
<ul>
<li>
It is read-only. It does not support writing.</li>

<li>
HDF5 named datatypes are not supported.</li>

<li>
HDF5 ARRAY datatype with compound member is not supported.</li>

<li>
Nested compound datatype is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
To Obtain</h2>
The HDF Object Package is freely available, as a full source release. Compiled
jar files are available, and compiled native libraries are available for
selected platforms.
<p><i>Prerequisites</i>
<p>The HDF Object Package requires <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">the
Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a> and
<a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">the Java
HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>. These are included in the distribution.
<p>The HDF Object Package was developed using Java 2 SDK (JDK 1.2.x and
JDK 1.3.x). The HDF Object Package no platform specific code, and should
work on any system with Java JDK 1.2.x or JDK 1.3.x. At the time of the
release, the code has been tested on Solaris, Linux, Windows 98/NT, and
SGI IRIX 6.5.
<h3>
<a NAME="#DOWNLOAD"></a><u>Download</u></h3>
The source and pre-built binaries for the HDF Object Package can be downloaded
from:
<blockquote><a href="ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java/">
ftp://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java/</a></blockquote>
<b>Binary release</b>
<p>The binary release includes jar files for the HDF Object Package, the
JHI (HDF4 library interface) and JHI5 (HDF5 library interface). The
native libraries are available for selected platforms.

<b>Source</b>
<p>The source distribution includes all the Java source to build the jar
files, plus the C source for the native methods of the <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">JHI</a>
and <a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">JHI5</a>.
<p>The JHI requires the HDF4.1r3 library (binary) and the JHI5 requires
the HDF5.1.4.3 library (binary). These are not included in the Java source.
