<h3>Source Distribution and Pre-Built Binaries</h3>

<p />
The <b>source distribution</b> and <b>pre-built binaries</b> are available from  
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/release/download.html">http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/release/download.html</a>.


<p />
The source distribution includes the Java code to build 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdf-java-html/hdfview/index.html">HDFView</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdf-java-html/hdf-object/index.html">Java HDF 
Object Package</a>, and related HDF4 and HDF5 Object Packages. 
The source distribution also includes Java classes that declare the native 
methods for 

<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdf-java-html/JNI/jhi/index.html">Java HDF 
Interface (JHI)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdf-java-html/JNI/jhi5/index.html">Java HDF5 
Interface (JHI5)</a> and C code that implements the native methods. 


<p />
JHI requires the HDF4 library (binary), and JHI5 requires the HDF5 
library (binary). These are not included in the HDF Java Products source 
distribution. The HDF libraries can be obtained from the <A 
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html">HDF Downloads</A> page.

<p />
Building the HDF Java Products from the source distribution is an easy 
endeavor. There are CMake specialized compressed sources for all the required libraries. 
Refer to the following the instructions for more details: 

<ul class="ul">
  <li><a 
  href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/release/cmakebuild.html">Building 
  from source using CMake</a> </li>
</ul>

<p />
The pre-built binaries include all of the HDF Java Products listed in the 
table above and the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries required by JHI and JHI5.
Binaries are provided for <b>Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,</b> and <b>Windows with JRE</b>.
