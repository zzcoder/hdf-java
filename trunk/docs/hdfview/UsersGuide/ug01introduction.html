<h2>
<a NAME="ug01overview"></a>1.0 What It Is</h2>
<p>
The HDFView is a Java-based tool for browsing and editing NCSA HDF4 and HDF5 files.
HDFView allows users to browse through any HDF4 and HDF5 file; starting with a tree
view of all top-level objects in an HDF file's hierarchy. HDFView allows
a user to descend through the hierarchy and navigate among the file's data
objects. The content of a data object is loaded only when the object is
selected, providing interactive and efficient access to HDF4 and HDF5 files. HDFView
editing features allow a user to create, delete, and modify the value of
HDF objects and attributes.

<p>
The HDFView user interface is designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
HDFView was implemented by using Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
2 Platform that is designed to be machine-independent. The interface and
features of the HDFView are the same for all platforms. HDFView displays
the structure of the HDF file in a tree with data groups and data objects
represented as conventional folders and icons. Users can easily expand
or collapse folders to navigate the hierarchical structure of an HDF file.

<h2>
<a NAME="ug01release"></a>1.1 About This Release</h2>
<p>
This release includes bug fixes, new features, test suite, and improved documentation.

<p>
<h4>Platforms</h4>
This release was built and tested for the follwing platforms:

<h5>32-bit Java 2 SDK</h5>
<ul class="ul">
  <li> Linux </li>
  <li> Solaris </li>
  <li> Mac PowerPC </li>
  <li> Mac Intel </li>
  <li> Windows (Vista/XP/2000) </li>
</ul>

<h5>64-bit Java 2 SDK</h5>
<ul class="ul">
  <li> Linux 64-bit AMD </li>
  <li> Solaris 64-bit </li>
</ul>

<h5>The following platforms are droped from this release</h5>
<ul class="ul">
  <li> AIX </li>
  <li> Irix </li>
  <li> OSF1 </li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>New features</h4>
There are a lot of new features added to the release. The following is a list
of major new features.
<ul class="ul">
  <li>Support for compound datatypes containing 2D arrays (or greater) </li>
  <li>Create/display named datatypes in an HDF5 file </li>
  <li>Copy object to same group w/different name </li>
  <li>Allow creation of dataset with enum type/named datatype </li>
  <li>Support for "filtering fillvalue" to Image Viewer </li>
  <li>Show actual palette that results from palette manipulation </li>
  <li>Add ability to create a chunked dataset with compound datatype </li>
  <li>Deal with large number of 8kx8k 3D images by reuse the memory data buffer</li>
  <li>Add -geometry switch to set the window size and location</li>
  <li>Support large Fonts in GUI components</li>
  <li>Grad and drag to move/browse a image </li>
  <li>Add autogain algorithm for image Brightness/Contrast </li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Bug fix</h4>
There are many bug fixes in HDF-Java 2.4. One of the major bugs is the <strong>
memory leak</strong> as explained in the follwoing.

<p>
In HDF-Java 2.3 or earlier version, an attribute and datatype were left open when
the file structure was retrieved from a file. The following code will build up the 
memory leak until the machine is out of memory.

<pre>
while (true) 
{
    H5File f=new H5File(fname, H5File.READ);
    f.open();
    f.close();
}
</pre>

Another memory leak is at compound datasets. When a compound dataset is open, we
keep the datatypes of the compound fields in memory so that we can reuse them for
better perfomance. However, these datatypes were not closed when the file is closed. 
The following code will make the JVM run out of memory.

<pre>
while (true)
{
    final H5File file = new H5File(fname, H5File.READ);
    final Dataset dset = (Dataset)file.get("/Table0");
    dset.init();

    file.close();
}
</pre>

<p>
<h4>Other enhancements</h4>

<dl>
<dt>Test suite</dt>
<dd>Using the junit test frame, we build a test suite to test all the public APIs 
in the object package (ncsa.hdf.object) and the HDF5 object package (ncsa.hdf.object.h5).
The test suite is added into the source configuration to make it easy to run by "make check"</dd>
<dt>Improved documentation</dt>
<dd>All the public APIs in the object package (ncsa.hdf.object) and the HDF5 object package 
(ncsa.hdf.object.h5) are fully documented.</dd>
</dl>

<!--
<h3>Modular components</h3>
<p>
HDFView version 2.0 is the first release of the modular HDFView. It includes bug fixes
and new features. The main difference between version 2.0 and its previous releases is that
this version is built on replaceable I/O and GUI modules. For more information
about HDFView modules, please read "A User's Guide on How to Implement HDFView Modules"
at <a href="/hdf-java-html/hdfview/ModularGuide/">
/hdf-java-html/hdfview/ModularGuide/</a>

<p>
Early versions of HDFView (version 1.3 or earlier) are implemented with standard
GUI components such as tree view, table, and image view. These components cannot
be replaced. There is no optional tree view, table view, and etc for users to
display the data the way they want.  version  or modular HDFView is built
on modules of I/O and GUI components.
<p>
Modular HDFView is an improved HDFView where I/O and GUI components are
replaceable modules. It consists of several interfaces that enable users to write
and use alternative implementations to replace default modules. The current
replaceable modules include:
<ul class="ul">
<li>File I/O (already implemented)
<li>Image view
<li>Table view (a spreadsheet-like layout)
<li>Text view
<li>Metadata (metadata and attributes) view
<li>Tree view
<li>Palette view
</ul>

<P>
HDFView 2.3 is build on the common object package or the abstract I/O layer,
<i>ncsa.hdf.object</i>, which provides classes that reflect fundamental design
of object-oriented data objects. Objects of file elements such as groups and
dataset are presented as Java classes. The package includes abstract classes
for users to build their implementation subclasses. Two default implementations
for HDF4 and HDF5, ncsa.hdf.object.h4 and ncsa.hdf.object.h5, are included in
the distribution.For more details, read<br>
<a href="/hdf-java-html/hdf-object">the HDF Object Package</A>.

<p>
The abstract GUI components include the TreeView, ImageView, TableView, TextView,
and MetadataView (for metadata and attributes).  More GUI components may be
added by user request in the future. Default implementation of the GUI modules
are provided. The TreeView defines the interfaces that manipulate the file
structure such as read data content, and add/delete data object. The ImageView,
TableView, and TextView define APIs that display and manipulate data values.
MetadataView defines interfaces to display and modify metadata and attributes.
