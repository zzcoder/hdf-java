<h2>
<a NAME="ug01overview"></a>1.0 What It Is</h2>
<p>
The HDFView is a Java-based tool for browsing and editing NCSA HDF4 and HDF5 files.
HDFView allows users to browse through any HDF4 and HDF5 file; starting with a tree
view of all top-level objects in an HDF file's hierarchy. HDFView allows
a user to descend through the hierarchy and navigate among the file's data
objects. The content of a data object is loaded only when the object is
selected, providing interactive and efficient access to HDF4 and HDF5 files. HDFView
editing features allow a user to create, delete, and modify the value of
HDF objects and attributes.

<p>
The HDFView user interface is designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
HDFView was implemented by using Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
2 Platform that is designed to be machine-independent. The interface and
features of the HDFView are the same for all platforms. HDFView displays
the structure of the HDF file in a tree with data groups and data objects
represented as conventional folders and icons. Users can easily expand
or collapse folders to navigate the hierarchical structure of an HDF file.

<h2>
<a NAME="ug01release"></a>1.1 About This Release</h2>
<p>
This release includes bug fixes and a few new features. <strong>The following
is a list of major changes.</strong>
<p>
<UL>
    <li>Fix bugs
    <li>Support for HDF-SRB (Windows and Linux)
    <li>Update HDF5 library to release 1.6.5
    <Li>Support for compound datatypes containing 2D arrays (or greater)
    <Li>Create/display named datatypes in HDF5
    <li>Create link in hdf5
    <li>Improve ability to manipulate palette
    <li>Select row/colunm data as X axis for xy plot in the table view
</UL>
<p>
The <b>HDF-SRB model</b> is a client-server model that provides interactive and efficient
access to remote HDF5 files. Like most client/server model, the HDF-SRB model is
implemented on a set of client and server APIs and message passing scheme. Unlike
other client/server model, the HDF-SRB model is object oriented. The client can
access datasets or subsets of datasets in large files without bringing entire files
into local machines. For more details, please read the
<a href="/hdf-srb-html/HDF-SRB-UG.html">HDF-SRB User's Guide</a>.

<p>
HDFView version 2.0 is the first release of the modular HDFView. It includes bug fixes
and new features. The main difference between version 2.0 and its previous releases is that
this version is built on replaceable I/O and GUI modules. For more information
about HDFView modules, please read "A User's Guide on How to Implement HDFView Modules"
at <a href="/hdf-java-html/hdfview/ModularGuide/">
/hdf-java-html/hdfview/ModularGuide/</a>

<p>
Early versions of HDFView (version 1.3 or earlier) are implemented with standard
GUI components such as tree view, table, and image view. These components cannot
be replaced. There is no optional tree view, table view, and etc for users to
display the data the way they want.  version  or modular HDFView is built
on modules of I/O and GUI components.
<p>
Modular HDFView is an improved HDFView where I/O and GUI components are
replaceable modules. It consists of several interfaces that enable users to write
and use alternative implementations to replace default modules. The current
replaceable modules include:
<ul>
<li>File I/O (already implemented)
<li>Image view
<li>Table view (a spreadsheet-like layout)
<li>Text view
<li>Metadata (metadata and attributes) view
<li>Tree view
<li>Palette view
</ul>

<P>
HDFView 2.3 is build on the common object package or the abstract I/O layer,
<i>ncsa.hdf.object</i>, which provides classes that reflect fundamental design
of object-oriented data objects. Objects of file elements such as groups and
dataset are presented as Java classes. The package includes abstract classes
for users to build their implementation subclasses. Two default implementations
for HDF4 and HDF5, ncsa.hdf.object.h4 and ncsa.hdf.object.h5, are included in
the distribution.For more details, read<br>
<a href="/hdf-java-html/hdf-object">the HDF Object Package</A>.

<p>
The abstract GUI components include the TreeView, ImageView, TableView, TextView,
and MetadataView (for metadata and attributes).  More GUI components may be
added by user request in the future. Default implementation of the GUI modules
are provided. The TreeView defines the interfaces that manipulate the file
structure such as read data content, and add/delete data object. The ImageView,
TableView, and TextView define APIs that display and manipulate data values.
MetadataView defines interfaces to display and modify metadata and attributes.

<h2>
<a NAME="ug01limitations"></a>1.3 Limitations</h2>

<strong>The current implementation of HDFView has the following limitations.</strong><p>
<ul>
<p>
<LI>
HDFView does not support undo operation; all the changes will go
to the physical file, and the editing results cannot be recovered.
<p><LI>
Deleting object/attribute in HDF4 is not supported.
<p><LI>
HDFView does not support conversion between HDF4 and HDF5.
<p><li>
HDFView does not display named datatypes.</li>
<p><li>
HDFView supports only indexed image with RGB color model or 24-bit true
color image. It does not support other color models such as CMYK and HSV.</li>
<p><li>
Opening a large image or dataset may cause an "out of memory" error due to
the limitations of the Java virtual machine.</li>
<p><li>
HDFView is implemented in Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 Platform.
It builds and runs on jdk1.4.x. It does not buid on jdk1.3.x or earlier version.
It may run on jdk1.3.x but it is not tested on jdk1.3.x.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="ug01requirements"></a>1.4 System Requirements</h2>

The HDFView is distributed in two forms: No_VM_bundled and VM_bundled. The No_VM_bundled
distribution does not contain the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) while the VM_bundled
distribution bundles the JRE.

<p>
To run HDFView with No_VM_bundled distribution, JDK1.4.x is required. The HDFView
does not compile on jdk1.3.x or earlier version. It may run on jdk1.3.x but it
is not tested on jdk1.3.x.

<h3>Java Virtual Machine Required</h3>
The NoVM_bundled binary distribution does not contain the Java 2 Runtime Environment.
The NoVM_bundled requires JDK1.4.1 or JDK1.4.2. Before you install the NoVM_bundled
distribution, you must have JDK1.4.1 or JDK1.4.2 installed on your machine. If you don't
have a Java 2 VM, you must download and install one. As all releases of <B>Macintosh
OS X </B>include a fully functional Java 2 Virtual Machine, there is no need for a
Mac OS X JRE.

<h3>StandAlone Application [JRE Bundled]</h3>
JRE1.4.1 is bundled in the VM_bundled distribution. You do not need any aditional
software to run HDFView.

<p>
Download and installation of HDFView requires acceptance of the Java 2 Runtime
Environment license agreement. Please read the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/j2re-1_3_1_02-license.html">
Java 2 Runtime Environment Binary Code License Agreement</a> before you
download the VM_bundled distribution. The installation program will <b>not</b>
install HDFView unless you accept the Java 2 Runtime Environment
License Agreement.
<p>
<h3>Install on Unix or MAC OS X</h3>
After downloading the installation file,  cd to the directory where you
downloaded the installer. At the prompt type:
<br><b>sh ./hdfview-xxx.bin</b>,
<br>where xxx is the Unix OS name such as solaris, linux or macosx. The installer
will guide you to select the Java Virtual Machine and HDFView home directory
(where you want to install the HDFView).
<p>
<h3>Install on Windows</h3>
After downloading, double-click
<br><b>hdfview-windows.exe</b>.<p>
The installer will guide you to select the Java Virtual Machine and
HDFView home directory (where you want to install the HDFView). After
installing, you can launch the HDFView from
<br>
Start -> Program Files -> NCSA HDFView
