Major enhancements
==================================================================================================================  
    * Select the firt file to open family files from HDFView
	* Ignore NaN and INF values for better line plots from TableView
	* Allow to set fill value when creating a new dataset
	* Copy object to a group where the name already exist and resolve name conflict
	* Import/export image palette from/to a text file
	* Provide an option to show data values in 0-based or 1-based index
	* Choose image origin of UpperLeft, LowerLeft, UpperRight, and LowerRight
	* Add options to show values of selected bits or apply a bitmask for 1-byte or 2-byte integers
	* Add data distribution histogram for changing data range in ImageView


Major bug Fixes
================================================================================================================== 
    * Fixed a HDFView crash on region references on nested compound fileds
	* Added serializable interferce and tests to all hdf-java objects
	* Added information of coordinates of selected data to the column header for 2D+ string daasets
	* Fixed a failure on refresh image palette table when palette values were changed
 	* Fixed TableView to allow flip through data of 3D compound dataset
	* Fixed HDF4 SDS creation so that unlimited dims is not allowed to be used with compression or chunk
	* Fixed HDF-Java objects to use "/" for the root group instead of the file name
	* Fixed HDFView to allow rename named datatypes
	* Fixed HDFView to allow view content of nested external links pointing to objects in different files


Limitations / Known Problems
==================================================================================================================  
    * HDFView does not support undo operations; the editing results go to files and cannot be recovered.
    * HDFView does not support conversion between HDF4 and HDF5.
    * HDFView supports only indexed images with RGB color model or 24-bit true color image. 
    * Directly using multiple dimensional arrays causes a performance problem because there is no direct mapping 
      for multiple dimensional arrays between Java and C.
    * HDF (4&5) APIs with function pointers are not supported in HDF-Java. 

    * Specific to HDF4:
          -- Deleting an object or attribute from an HDF4 file is not supported. Deleting objects in HDF4 may leave 
             dangling objects or corrupt the file.
          -- HDFView cannot modify compressed HDF4 SDS if rank is greater than two because the existing compression 
             algorithms supported by HDF do not allow partial modification to a compressed data stream.
          -- HDFView cannot modify HDF4 vdata. HDF4 only writes vdata by records while HDF-Java reads data by vdata 
             fields since HDF-Java does not support the data structure of a vdata record.

    * Specific to HDF5:
          -- Writing compound data is limited to simple cases. For example, the base compound fields have primitive 
             types such as integers, floats, characters, etc. HDFView does not write complex compound data. For
             example, the type of a compound field is a dataset region reference.
          -- Writing variable-length data is not supported except for datasets where 
             each data point is a single variable-length string.
          -- There is no single JNI function that can handle HDF5 library functions that have different return 
             types for version 1.6 and version 1.8. An additional function is added in the JNI. For example,
             * public synchronized static native int H5Tget_size(int type_id)
             * public synchronized static native long H5Tget_size_long(int type_id)

Other Notes
==================================================================================================================  
Made the following changes to bin/hdfview.sh to make it consistent with the Windows batch 
file, bin/hdfview.bat:
    * changed "HDFVIEW_HOME" to "HDFJAVA" and "JAVAPATH" to "JAVAHOME"
