HDF Libraries
==============================================================================================
This release was built and tested with HDF 4.2.8 and HDF5 1.8.11. 
$YOUR-HDF-JAVA-HOME/lib/<platform>/*.settings files include information on the platform 
version and compiler used to build hdf4 and hdf5.

JDK
==============================================================================================
This release was built and tested with JDK 1.7. 


Platforms
==============================================================================================
This release was built and tested for the following platforms:

64-bit distribution -- runs on 64-bit systems with 64-bit JRE only
    * Linux
    * Mac Intel
    * Solaris
    * Windows

32-bit distribution -- runs on 32-bit systems or 64-bit systems with 32-bit JRE
    * Linux
    * Mac Intel
    * Solaris
    * Windows


Changes to the Java HDF5 Interface(JHI5)
==============================================================================================
    -- Added options to sort file objects by index

Major Enhancements
==============================================================================================  
    * NA


Major Bug Fixes
============================================================================================== 
    * Fixed HDFView to display 64-bit unsigned integers
    * Fixed HDFView to display SCALAR arrays 


Limitations / Known Problems
==============================================================================================  
    * HDFView does not support undo operations; the editing results go to 
      files and cannot be recovered.
    * HDFView does not support conversion between HDF4 and HDF5.
    * HDFView supports only indexed images with RGB color model or 24-bit 
      true color images. 
    * Directly using multiple dimensional arrays causes a performance 
      problem because there is no direct mapping for multiple dimensional 
      arrays between Java and C.
    * HDF (4&5) APIs with function pointers are not supported in HDF-Java. 
    * HDF-Java does not support any filter/feature that is not compiled and
      distributed with the HDF4/5 libraries. For example, HDFView will not 
      be able to show data that requires a compresson filter that is not 
      in the HDF4 or HDF5 library.

    * Specific to HDF4:
        -- Deleting an object or attribute from an HDF4 file is not supported. 
           Deleting objects in HDF4 may leave dangling objects or corrupt 
           the file.
        -- HDFView cannot modify compressed HDF4 SDS if rank is greater 
           than two because the existing compression algorithms supported 
           by HDF do not allow partial modification to a compressed data stream.
        -- HDFView cannot modify HDF4 vdata. HDF4 only writes vdata by records. 
           HDF-Java reads data by vdata fields because HDF-Java does not 
           support the data structure of a vdata record.

    * Specific to HDF5:
        -- Writing compound data is limited to simple cases. For example, 
           base compound fields that have primitive types such as integers, 
           floats, characters, etc. can be written. HDFView does not write 
           complex compound data. For example, HDFView cannot write a dataset 
           that has a compound datatype with a region reference.
        -- Writing variable-length data is not supported except for datasets 
           where each data point is a single variable-length string.
        -- There is no single JNI function that can handle HDF5 library 
           functions that have different return types for version 1.6 and 
           version 1.8. An additional function is added in the JNI. For example,
             * public synchronized static native int H5Tget_size(int type_id)
             * public synchronized static native long H5Tget_size_long(int type_id)

Other Notes
==============================================================================================  
Made the changes to Examples to eliminate deprecated functions.
