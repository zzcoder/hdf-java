64-bit distribution -- runs on 64-bit systems with 64-bit JRE only
    * Linux

Supporting for HDF5 1.8
========================================================================================= 
    * HDF5 JNI:- Changes to Java HDF5 Interface(JHI5) include:
          -- 101 methods were added to JHI5 to support HDF5 1.8.
          -- Changes were made to 17 methods in JHI5 for supporting the compatibility 
             between HDF5 1.6 and 1.8
          -- Unit tests were added for all the new methods added to JHI5. 

    * HDFJava Object Layer:- Changes in the Java HDF Object package include:
          -- Set the bounds of library versions
          -- Set link creation order
          -- Set link storage type
          -- Show groups in creation order
          -- Create soft and external links
          -- Retrieve link information
          -- Show attributes in creation order

    * HDFView:- Changes for supporting HDF5 1.8 in HDFView include:
          -- Set the bounds of library versions of an open file
          -- Show the bounds of library versions of an open file
          -- Set link creation order in groups
          -- Set link storage type when creating a group
          -- Create soft and external links
          -- Show link information


Other Major Improvements
========================================================================================= 
    * Use H5Ocopy() for copying datasets or groups (important for large datasets)
    * Show the values of specific bit(s) packed in a byte or two-byte integer
    * Show and modify dangling links
    * Rename attributes
    * Show the names of the palettes in HDFView
    * Move objects within the same HDF5 file
    * Export and import data to/from a binary file


Major Bug Fixes
=========================================================================================
    * HDFView: cannot copy+paste a 1024^3-64bit-float-dataset.
    * HDFView: problem copying large datasets in HDFView
    * HDFView: image for an unsigned short dataset with a fill value causes an exception
    * HDFView: image displayed incorrectly if you swap dimensions
    * HDFView: displays 3D data incorrectly when rotate dimensions
    * HDFView: export table includes extra TAB separator between values
    * Missing unit tests for H5R package 
    * HDFView: failed to copy large dataset
    * Can't copy/paste large array from Table menu to Excel
    * Make all Java classes portable for 32-bit and 64-bit


Limitations / Known Problems
========================================================================================= 
    * HDFView does not support undo operations; all changes will go to the physical file, 
      and the editing results cannot be recovered.
    * HDFView does not support conversion between HDF4 and HDF5.
    * HDFView supports only indexed images with RGB color model or 24-bit true color image. 
      It does not support other color models such as CMYK and HSV.
    * Directly using multiple dimensional arrays causes a performance problem because there 
      is no direct mapping for multiple dimensional array between Java and C.
    * HDF (4&5) APIs with function pointers are not supported in HDF-Java. 

    * Specific to HDF4:
          -- Deleting object/attribute in HDF4 is not supported.
          -- HDFView cannot modify compressed HDF4 SDS if rank is greater than two because 
             the existing compression algorithms supported by HDF do not allow partial 
             modification to a compressed data stream.
          -- HDFView cannot modify HDF4 vdata. HDF4 only writes vdata by records while hdf-java 
             reads data by vdata fields since hdf-java does not support the data structure of 
             a vdata record.

    * Specific to HDF5:
          -- Writing nested compound data of HDF5 is limited to some simple cases. HDFView 
             does not write complex compound data.
          -- Writing variable length data is not supported except for dataset where each data
             point is a single variable length string.
          -- Adding an additional function for the JNI functions that return an "int" in HDF5 
             1.6 but require a "long" return value in HDF5 1.8. For example,
             public synchronized static native int H5Tget_size(int type_id)
             public synchronized static native long H5Tget_size_long(int type_id)

Other notes
========================================================================================= 
Made the following changes to the running script, bin/hdfview.sh, to make it consistent to 
the Windows batch file, bin/hdfview.bat:
    change "HDFVIEW_HOME" to "HDFJAVA" and "JAVAPATH" to "JAVAHOME"
