The <b>HDF Java Products</b> include 
a visual tool for browsing and editing HDF files, 
a Java package providing an object-oriented interface to HDF data objects,
and Java Native Interfaces to the standard HDF libraries.    
The HDF Java Products work with both HDF4 and HDF5 files.
<p>
The HDF Java Products were revised and reorganized beginning with version 2.0. 
HDFView replaced JHV and H5View, the original HDF4 and HDF5 viewers.

<h2>Download HDF Java Products</h2>

<p>
To download a specific HDF Java Product, follow the Product link in the 
table above and select Download from the product page.

<p>
Source code for all HDF Java Products, 
as well as pre-built binaries for many platforms,
can be downloaded from 
<a href="ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/">
ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/</a>.

<p>
<h3>Source</h3>

<p>
The source distribution, found under the <b>src</b> directory at the ftp site,  
includes the Java code to build
<a href="hdfview/index.html">HDFView</a>,
the <a href="./hdf-object/index.html">Java HDF Object Package</a>,
and related HDF4 and HDF5 Object Packages.

<p>
The source distribution also includes Java classes that 
declare the native methods for 
<a href="./JNI/jhi/index.html">Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a>
and <a href="./JNI/jhi5/index.html">Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>,
and C code that implements the native methods.
JHI requires the HDF4 4.2r1 library (binary) 
and JHI5 requires the HDF5 1.6.5 library (binary), 
which are not included in the HDF Java Products source distribution.
The HDF libraries can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html"> HDF Downloads</a> page.

<p>
Building the HDF Java Products from the source distribution is not an
easy endeavor.
Refer to the following the instructions for more details:
<UL>
 <LI><A HREF="./build_src_unix.html">Building from source on Unix and MacOSX</A>
 <LI><A HREF="./build_src_windows.html">Building from source on Windows</A>
</UL>

<p>
<h3>Pre-Built Binaries</h3>

<p>
The pre-built binaries, found under the <b>bin</b> directory at the ftp site, 
include all of the HDF Java Products listed in the table above, 
as well as the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries required by JHI and JHI5.   

<p>
The binary files are distributed in several formats including
.jar files, .tar files, and packaged with an installer program.

<p>
Binaries are provided for 
<b>linux, macosx, solaris,</b> and <b>windows</b> 
in the corresonding <b>platform</b> subdirectories of 
<a href="ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/bin">ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/bin</a>.
README files in the platform directories on the ftp site 
describe the packaging formats and corresponding files for each
specific platform.
