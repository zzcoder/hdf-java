This document describes the design of the <b>HDF Object Package</b> and the class hierarchy.
To know how to use the package, read <A HREF="use.html">Use and Examples</A> for more details.

<h2>
What it is</h2>
The <b>HDF Object Package</b> is a Java package which implement HDF4 and
HDF5 data objects in an object-oriented form. The HDF Java Object Package
provides a common standard Java API to access both HDF4 and HDF5 files.
<p>The HDF Object Package is <b>NOT</b> a "wrapper" for the native HDF
libraries; The HDF4 and HDF5 wrappers are separate HDF Java products. For
details of the HDF4 and HDF5 native interfaces, read <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">NCSA
Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a> and
<a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">NCSA
Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>. The HDF Object Package wraps these
interfaces with a higher level object model.
<p>The HDF Object Package, <i>ncsa.hdf.object</i>, provides classes that
reflect fundamental conceptual to design of HDF objects. Objects
of HDF5 (group and dataset) and HDF4 (group, multi-dimension array, raster
image, vdata and annotation) are presented as Java classes.

<p>The HDF object package has three major goals. First, it simplifies the
process of reading information from or writing data to file because the
details of accessing to the HDF library are encapsulated into respective
classes. For example, it may take over ten library calls to get an image
from HDF5 file while the image object provides a single convenient call
to achieve the same task.

<p>Second, the HDF object package hides the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries from
applications. Applications can use of the HDF Object Package to access
objects from either HDF4 or HDF5 without accessing the libraries directly.
This will be very useful in the case of client-server application. The
server machine may have HDF files and the HDF library to access the files
while the client application which built on the HDF object model doe not
need the HDF library.

<p>Third, the HDF object package provides modular HDF4 and HDF5 packages.
Application can be built without requiring the HDF4 or HDF5 library.
HDF4 and HDF5 objects are inherited from a common object/interface
layer. Applications can be built by using only the common object/interface
layer. For example, the HDFView in built on the common object/interface
layer. It compiles and runs without the HDF4 or HDF5 library.

<h2>
The Object Package</h2>
The following diagram explains the structure of the HDF object package
and how to use it. Package ncsa.hdf.object contains the common object/interface.
This package only defines interfaces or abstract classes for accessing HDF files.
The implementation will rely on the HDF4/HDF5 object package. Application classes
should only include ncsa.hdf.object.

<p>
The ncsa.hdf.object.h4 is an implementation of the HDF4 objects. It implements
the interfaces and abstract classes defined at ncsa.hdf.object package. The
HDF4 object package requires the HDF4 Java Native Interface (ncsa.hdf.hdflib).
Application should not include this package so that it compiles and runs without
the HDF4 library.

<p>
The ncsa.hdf.object.h5 is an implementation of the HDF5 objects. It implements
the interfaces and abstract classes defined at ncsa.hdf.object package. The
HDF5 object package requires the HDF5 Java Native Interface (ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib).
Application should not include this package so that it compiles and runs without
the HDF5 library.

<h2>
The class hierarchy</h2>
The HDF Object Package implements an abstract data model, and the objects
of the HDF4 and HDF5 data models are represented as instances of the abstract
objects. The abstract class <b>HObject</b> has two fundamental abstract
classes are <b>Group</b> and <b>Dataset</b>, and all HDF5 and HDF4 objects
are a sub-type of one of these abstract classes.
<p>Figure 1 shows the class hierarchy of the HDF Object Package. <!--<i>{Peter
-- the dependency to the HDF Library Package is not identical to my diagram
below. We need to decide on a common way to show it in UML.}--></i>
<p>The classes are explained in the Java class document
 <a href="../javadocs/index.html">the Javadocs</a>.

<h2>
Limitations</h2>
The current version of the HDF Object Package has the following limitations:
<ul>
<li>
HDF5 named datatypes are not supported.</li>

<li>
HDF5 ARRAY datatype with compound member is not supported.</li>

<li>
Nested compound datatype is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
To Obtain</h3>
The HDF Object Package is freely available, as a full source release. Compiled
jar files are available, and compiled native libraries are available for
selected platforms.
<p><i>Prerequisites</i>
<p>The HDF Object Package requires <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">the
Java HDF Interface (JHI)</a> and
<a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">the Java
HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</a>. These are included in the distribution.
<p>The HDF Object Package was developed using Java 2 SDK (JDK 1.2.x and
JDK 1.3.x). The HDF Object Package no platform specific code, and should
work on any system with Java JDK 1.2.x or JDK 1.3.x. At the time of the
release, the code has been tested on Solaris, Linux, Windows 98/NT, and
SGI IRIX 6.5.<hr>
<h3>
<a NAME="#DOWNLOAD"></a>Download</h3>
The source and pre-built binaries for the HDF Object Package can be downloaded
from:
<blockquote><a href="ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/">
ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/</a></blockquote>
<b>Binary release</b>
<p>The binary release includes jar files for the HDF Object Package, the
JHI (HDF4 library interface) and JHI5 (HDF5 library interface). The
native libraries are available for selected platforms.

<h3>Source</h3>
<p>The source distribution includes all the Java source to build the jar
files, plus the C source for the native methods of the <a href="../JNI/jhi/index.html">JHI</a>
and <a href="../JNI/jhi5/index.html">JHI5</a>.
<p>The JHI requires the HDF4.1r5 library (binary) and the JHI5 requires
the HDF5.1.4.4 library (binary). These are not included in the Java source.
