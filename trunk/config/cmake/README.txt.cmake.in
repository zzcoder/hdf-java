The compressed examples file HDFJavaExamples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@, located in the 
@HDFJAVA_PACKAGE_NAME@ install folder, can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied
HDFJAVA_Examples.cmake file. The HDFJAVA_Examples.cmake expects @HDFJAVA_PACKAGE_NAME@ to have
been installed in the default location with JAVA @Java_VERSION_STRING@ installed.

    Copy HDFJavaExamples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@ to this directory, do NOT unzip.
    Copy HDFJAVA_Examples.cmake to this directory.
    Edit HDFJAVA_Examples.cmake line 8 to set INSTALLDIR to where @HDFJAVA_PACKAGE_NAME@ is installed.
    Execute from this directory: 
        ctest -S HDFJAVA_Examples.cmake,HDFJavaExamples-0.1.1-Source -C Release -O test.log

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file, test.log, as
indicated by the ctest command. If you wish the to see more build and test information, 
add "-VV" to the ctest command.
