                               HDF-Java Products
*******************************************************************************


The HDF Java Products include three distinct components:
===============================================================================
    1) Java HDF Interface (JHI4 & JHI5): a Java Native Interface to the 
       standard HDF (4&5) libraries
    2) Java HDF Object Package: a Java package that implements HDF data 
       objects in an object-oriented form
    3) HDFView: a visual tool for browsing and editing HDF files


Features and changes
===============================================================================
For major changes, please read "About This Release" at 
http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/


Files included in the release
===============================================================================
1) The "hdfview/" directory contains the installation programs for easy
   download and installation for HDFView. The installation programs are
   named by platforms. For example, "hdfview_install_linux32.bin" if for 
   32-bit linux machines. After you install HDFView, you have the pre-built 
   binaries for all the HDF-Java products: JNI wrapper, object package, 
   and HDFView.

2) The "bin/" directory includes the pre-built binaries for all of the
    HDF-Java product. You can either download the tarball, which has all 
    the necessary binaries, or individual part of pre-built binaries. 
    We strongly recommend you to download the tarball instead of individual
    files.

3) The "src/" directory has all of the source code for the HDF-Java product.
    You will only need it if you are building HDF-Java from the source.
