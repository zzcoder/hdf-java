========================================================================
I. Preconditions
========================================================================
Obtaining HDF-JAVA source code 
   1. Create a directory for your development; for example, "myhdfstuff".

   2. Obtain compressed (*.tar or *.zip) HDF-JAVA source from
        http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/hdf-java/current/src/
      and put it in "myhdfstuff".
      Do not uncompress.

CMake version
   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake from the Kitware web site. 
      The HDF-JAVA 2."X.Y" product requires a minimum CMake version 2.8.12,
      where "X.Y" is the current HDF-JAVA release version.                     


========================================================================
II. Quick Step Building HDF-JAVA Libraries with CMake Script Mode
========================================================================
This short set of instructions is written for users who want to quickly 
build the HDF-JAVA Library and HDFView from the HDF-JAVA source code package 
using the CMake tools. This procedure will use the default settings in the 
config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file. HDF Group recommends using the ctest script 
mode to build HDF-JAVA.

The following files referenced below are available at the HDF web site:
    http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java/release/cmakebuild.html

CMake build script:
    CTestScript.cmake

External compression szip and zlib libraries:
    SZip.tar.gz
    ZLib.tar.gz
    JPEG8b.tar.gz
    HDF4.tar.gz
    HDF5.tar.gz
    
Platform configuration files:
    HDFJAVAWindows64CMake.cmake
    HDFJAVAWindows32CMake.cmake
    HDFJAVALinuxCMake.cmake
    HDFJAVAMacCMake.cmake
    
To build HDF-JAVA with all the external libraries you will need to:

   1. Change to the development directory "myhdfstuff".
    
   2. Download the *.tar.gz files to "myhdfstuff".
      Do not uncompress the files.
       
   3. Download the CTestScript.cmake file to "myhdfstuff".
      CTestScript.cmake file should not be modified.    
       
   4. Download a platform configuration file to "myhdfstuff".
      Do not modify the file unless you want to change default build 
      environment.

   5. From the "myhdfstuff" directory execute the CTest Script with the 
      following options:

         ctest -S <configuration file> -C Release -VV -O hdfjava.log

      The command above will configure, build, test, and create an install 
      package in the myhdfstuff/hdf-java/build folder.

      The -S option uses the script version of ctest.
        
      The value for the -C option (as shown above, "-C Release") must 
      match the setting for CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION in the platform 
      configuration file.
        
      The -VV option is for verbose; use -V for less verbose.
        
      The "-O hdfjava.log" option saves the output to a log file hdfjava.log.

   6. To install, "X.Y" is the current release version
 
      On Windows, execute:
                HDFView-2."X.Y"-win32.exe or HDFView-2."X.Y"-win64.exe
      By default this program will install HDFView and the hdf-java library 
      into the "C:\Program Files" directory and will create the following 
      directory structure:
         HDF_Group
         --HDFView
         ----2."X.Y"
         ------bin
         ------cmake
         ------include
         ------javadocs
         ------lib
         ------samples

      On Linux, change to the install destination directory 
      (create it if doesn't exist) and execute:
                <path-to>/myhdfstuff/hdf-java/build/HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux.sh
      After accepting the license, the script will prompt:
        By default the HDF-JAVA will be installed in:
        "<current directory>/HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux"
        Do you want to include the subdirectory HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux?
        Saying no will install in: "<current directory>" [Yn]: 
      Note that the script will create the following directory structure
      relative to the install point:
         HDF_Group
         --HDFView
         ----2."X.Y"
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------javadocs
         ------lib
         ------samples
         ------share
      
      By default the installation will create the folders in the 
      <install destination directory>/HDF_Group/HDFView/2."X.Y" location.
                
      On Mac you will find HDFView-2."X.Y"-Darwin.dmg in the build folder. Click
      on the dmg file to proceed with installation. After accepting the license,
      there will be an application packaged named: HDFView

III. Quick Step Building HDFView and HDF-JAVA Static Libraries with CMake
========================================================================
Notes: This short set of instructions is written for users who want to 
       quickly build the just HDFView and the HDF-JAVA static library from 
       the HDF-JAVA source code package using the CMake command line tools.
       
   Go through these steps:

      1. Change to the development directory "myhdfstuff".

      2. Uncompress the HDF-JAVA source file
      
      3. Create a folder "build" in the "myhdfstuff" directory.
      
      4. Change into the "build" folder. 
      
      5. Configure HDFView, the library and tests with one of the following commands:

         On Windows 32 bit
           cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON ..\hdf-java-2."X.Y"

         On Windows 64 bit
           cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON ..\hdf-java-2."X.Y"
      
         On Linux and Mac
           cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON ../hdf-java-2."X.Y"

         where "X" is the current release version.
         
      6. Build HDFView, the library and tests with this command:
           cmake --build . --config Release
      
      7. Test HDFView and the library with this command:
           ctest . -C Release
      
      8. Create an install image with this command:
           cpack -C Release CPackConfig.cmake
      
      9. To install, "X.Y" is the current release version
 
         On Windows, execute:
                HDFView-2."X.Y"-win32.exe or HDFView-2."X.Y"-win64.exe
         By default this program will install HDFView and the hdf-java library 
         into the "C:\Program Files" directory and will create the following 
         directory structure:
            HDF_Group
            --HDFView
            ----2."X.Y"
            ------bin
            ------cmake
            ------include
            ------javadocs
            ------lib
            ------samples

         On Linux, change to the install destination directory 
         (create it if doesn't exist) and execute:
                <path-to>/myhdfstuff/hdf-java/build/HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux.sh
         After accepting the license, the script will prompt:
           By default the HDF-JAVA will be installed in:
           "<current directory>/HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux"
           Do you want to include the subdirectory HDFView-2."X.Y"-Linux?
           Saying no will install in: "<current directory>" [Yn]: 
         Note that the script will create the following directory structure
         relative to the install point:
            HDF_Group
            --HDFView
            ----2."X.Y"
            ------bin
            ------include
            ------javadocs
            ------lib
            ------samples
            ------share
      
         By default the installation will create the folders in the 
         <install destination directory>/HDF_Group/HDFView/2."X.Y" location.
                
         On Mac you will find HDFView-2."X.Y"-Darwin.dmg in the build folder. Click
         on the dmg file to proceed with installation. After accepting the license,
         there will be an application packaged named: HDFView


========================================================================
IV. Further considerations                                                           
========================================================================

   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake for windows from the Kitware
      web site. The HDF-JAVA 2.x product requires a minimum CMake version
      of 2.8.12.
                                                                         
   2. HDF-JAVA requires Zlib, Szip, Jpeg, hdf4, hdf5:
      A. Download the binary packages and install them in a central location. 
         For example on Windows, create a folder extlibs and install the 
         packages there. Add the following CMake options:
            -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/zlib.lib
            -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DSZIP_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/szlib.lib
            -DSZIP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DJPEG_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/jpeg.lib
            -DJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DHDF4_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/hdf.lib;some_location/lib/mfhdf.lib
            -DHDF4_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DHDF5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/hdf5.lib
            -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
         where "some_location" is the full path to the extlibs folder. 

      B. Use source packages from an SVN server by adding the following CMake 
         options:
         
            HDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="SVN"
            HDF4_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/hdf4/trunk"
            HDF5_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/hdf5/trunk"
            JPEG_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/jpeg/trunk"
            ZLIB_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/zlib/trunk"
            SZIP_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/szip/trunk"
         where "some_location" is the URL to the SVN repository. Also set
         CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to the configuration type.
         
      C. Use source packages from a compressed file by adding the following 
         CMake options:
            HDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
            HDF4_TGZ_NAME:STRING="hdf4_src.ext"
            HDF5_TGZ_NAME:STRING="hdf5_src.ext"
            JPEG_TGZ_NAME:STRING="jpeg_src.ext"
            ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext"
            SZIP_TGZ_NAME:STRING="szip_src.ext"
            TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
         where "some_location" is the URL or full path to the compressed 
         file and ext is the type of compression file. Also set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
         to the configuration type during configuration
                                    
   3. If you are building on Apple Darwin platforms, you should add the 
      following options:
          Compiler choice - use xcode by setting the ENV variables of CC and CXX
          Shared fortran is not supported, build static:
            BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
          Additional options:
            CMAKE_ANSI_CFLAGS:STRING=-fPIC
            CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=ON
            CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH:BOOL=OFF         
   
   4. Windows developers should install NSIS to create an install image with CPack.
      Visual Studio Express users will not be able to package HDF-JAVA into
      an install image executable.
   
   5. Developers can copy the config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file and alter the
      the settings for the developers' environment. Then the only options needed
      on the command line are those options that are different. Example using HDF
      default cache file:
           cmake -C ../config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" \
               -DHDF_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF \
               -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..

Notes: CMake and HDF-JAVA

   1. Using CMake for building and using HDF-JAVA is under active development. 
      While we have attempted to provide error-free files, please 
      understand that development with CMake has not been extensively 
      tested outside of HDF. The CMake specific files may change
      before the next release.
            
   2. CMake support for HDF-JAVA development should be usable on any 
      system where CMake is supported. Please send us any comments on 
      how CMake support can be improved on any system. Visit the 
      KitWare site for more information about CMake.
            
   3. Build and test results can be submitted to our CDash server at:
                 cdash.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu. 
      Please read the HDF and CDash document at:
                 www.hdfgroup.org/CDash/HowToSubmit. 
            
   4. See the appendix at the bottom of this file for examples of using
      a ctest script for building and testing. Using a ctest script is
      preferred because of its flexibility.
            
Notes: CMake in General

   1. More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare site at 
         www.cmake.org.
         
   2. CMake uses the command line; however, the visual CMake tool is 
      available for the configuration step. The steps are similar for
      all the operating systems supported by CMake.


========================================================================
V. Options for Building HDFView and HDF-JAVA Libraries with the CMake Command Line
========================================================================

To build HDFView and the HDF-JAVA Libraries with CMake, go through these five steps:

   1. Run CMake
   2. Configure the cache settings
   3. Build HDF-JAVA
   4. Test HDF-JAVA
   5. Package HDF-JAVA (create install image)

These five steps are described in detail below.

========================================================================

   1. Run CMake

      The visual CMake executable is named "cmake-gui.exe" on Windows and should be
      available in your Start menu. For Linux, UNIX, and Mac users the
      executable is named "cmake-gui" and can be found where CMake was 
      installed. 
      
      Specify the source and build directories. 
      
      ***** Make the build and source directories different. ******
      
      For example on Windows, if the source is at c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf-java, 
      then use c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf-java\build or c:\MyHDFstuff\build\hdf-java as the 
      build directory.
      
      RECOMMENDED:
        Users can perform the configuration step without using the visual 
        cmake-gui program. We use the file cacheinit.cmake in the 
        config/cmake source folder for our testing. This file enables all of the 
        basic options and we turn specific options on or off for testing 
        using the following command line within the build directory:
        
        cmake -C <sourcepath>/config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "<generator>"  [-D<options>]  <sourcepath>
        
        Where <generator> is:    
            * MinGW Makefiles
            * NMake Makefiles
            * Unix Makefiles
            * Visual Studio 12
            * Visual Studio 12 Win64
            * Visual Studio 11
            * Visual Studio 11 Win64
            * Visual Studio 10
            * Visual Studio 10 Win64

        <options> is:
            * HDF4_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to hdf4 includes directory>
            * HDF4_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to hdf4/library file>
            * HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to hdf5 includes directory>
            * HDF5_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to hdf5/library file>
            * SZIP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to szip includes directory>
            * SZIP_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to szip/library file>
            * ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to zlib includes directory>
            * ZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to zlib/library file>
            * JPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to jpeg includes directory>
            * JPEG_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to jpeg/library file>
            * <HDFJAVAOPTION>:BOOL=[ON | OFF]

        <cacheinit.cmake> is:

                set (JPEG_PACKAGE_NAME "jpeg" CACHE STRING "Name of JPEG package" FORCE)

   2. Configure the cache settings

      2.1  Visual CMake users, click the Configure button. If this is the first time you are 
           running cmake-gui in this directory, you will be prompted for the 
           generator you wish to use (for example on Windows, Visual Studio 11). 
           CMake will read in the CMakeLists.txt files from the source directory and 
           display options for the HDF-JAVA project. After the first configure you 
           can adjust the cache settings and/or specify the locations of other programs.
      
           Any conflicts or new values will be highlighted by the configure
           process in red. Once you are happy with all the settings and there are no 
           more values in red, click the Generate button to produce the appropriate 
           build files. 
      
           On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio generator, the solution and 
           project files will be created in the build folder.
      
           On linux, if you are using the Unix Makefiles generator, the Makefiles will
           be created in the build folder.

      2.2  Preferred command line example on Windows in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf-java\build directory:
      
               cmake -C ../config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "Visual Studio 11" \
               -DHDF_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF -DHDF_BUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF \
               -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..

      2.3  On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio Express version you must 
           be sure that the following two options are correctly set/unset:
           
           HDF_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON
           HDF_USE_FOLDERS:BOOL=OFF
           
   3. Build HDF-JAVA
   
      On Windows, you can build HDF-JAVA using either the Visual Studio Environment 
      or the command line. The command line can be used on all platforms;
      Windows, linux, Unix, and Mac.

      To build from the command line, navigate to your build directory and
      execute the following:
          
              cmake --build . --config {Debug | Release}     
              
      NOTE: "--config {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release on Windows.                                                                                      
             
      3.1  If you wish to use the Visual Studio environment, open the solution 
           file in your build directory. Be sure to select either Debug or 
           Release and build the solution.
             
      3.2.1  The external libraries (zlib, Szip, jpeg, hdf4 and hdf5) can be 
           configured to allow building the libraries by downloading from 
           an SVN repository. The option is 'HDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT'; 
           by adding the following configuration option:
               -DHDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="SVN"
               
           The options to control the SVN URL (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file) are:
               HDF4_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/hdf4/trunk"
               HDF5_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/hdf5/trunk"
               JPEG_SVN_URL:STRING="http://some_location/jpeg/trunk"
               ZLIB_SVN_URL:STRING="http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/zlib/trunk"
               SZIP_SVN_URL:STRING="http://svn.hdfgroup.uiuc.edu/szip/trunk"
           These should be changed to your location. Also define CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
           to be the configuration type.
           
      3.2.2  Or the external libraries (zlib, szip, jpeg, hdf4 and hdf5) can 
           be configured to allow building the libraries by using a compressed 
           file. The option is 'HDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT' and is enabled by 
           adding the following configuration option:
               -DHDF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
               
           The options to control the SVN URL (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake 
           file) are:
               HDF4_TGZ_NAME:STRING="hdf4_src.ext"
               HDF5_TGZ_NAME:STRING="hdf5_src.ext"
               JPEG_TGZ_NAME:STRING="jpeg_src.ext"
               ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext"
               SZIP_TGZ_NAME:STRING="szip_src.ext"
               TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
           where "some_location/xxxx_src.ext" is the URL or full path to 
           the compressed file and where ext is the type of the compression 
           file such as .bz2, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, or .zip. Also define
           CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to be the configuration type.

   4. Test HJAVA

      To test the build, navigate to your build directory and execute:
      
              ctest . -C {Debug | Release}
              
      NOTE: "-C {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release to match the build
            step on Windows.                                                                                      

   5. Packaging HDF-JAVA (create an install image)
   
      To package the build into a simple installer using the NullSoft 
      installer NSIS on Windows, or into compressed files (.tar.gz, .sh, 
      .zip), use the CPack tool.

      To package the build, navigate to your build directory and execute;
      
              cpack -C {Debug | Release} CPackConfig.cmake
      
      NOTE: See note 8 of this document for NSIS information.
            Also, if you are using a Visual Studio Express version or do not 
            want to enable the packaging components, set HDF_NO_PACKAGES 
            to ON (on the command line add -DHDF_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON)
           
   6. The files that support building HDF-JAVA with CMake are all the files 
      in the config/cmake folder, the CMakeLists.txt files in each source 
      folder, and CTestConfig.cmake. CTestConfig.cmake is specific to the 
      internal testing performed by The HDF Group. It should be altered for 
      the user's installation and needs. The cacheinit.cmake file settings are 
      used by The HDF Group for daily testing. It should be altered/ignored for 
      the user's installation and needs.

   7. More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare site,
        www.cmake.org.
      
   8. Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
      The Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) is an open source installation 
      system. It was created by the WinAmp authors to distribute that application, 
      but it is now a general-purpose system which anyone might use. NSIS installers 
      recognize /S for silent installation and /D=dir to specify the 
      "output directory", which is where the program will be installed. These 
      options are case-sensitive, so be sure to type them in upper case.

========================================================================
VII. User Defined Options for HDF-JAVA Libraries with CMake
========================================================================

Support for User Defined macros and options has been added. The file
UserMacros.cmake has an example of the technique. In the folder,
config/cmake/UserMacros, is an implementation for Windows Visual Studio
users for linking libraries to the static CRT - Windows_MT.cmake. 

Copy the contents of the file, both macro and option, into the 
UserMacros.cmake file. Then enable the option to the CMake configuration,
build and test process.

========================================================================
VIII. Options for Platform Configuration Files
========================================================================

Below is the HDFJAVALinuxCmake.cmake ctest script with extra comments.
The example is for a linux machine, but the same scripts can be used on 
a Windows machine by adjusting the CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR option in the
platform configuration script.
