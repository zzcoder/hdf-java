<font color="#FF0000"><b>The HDF Web-browser plugin, HDFPlugin, </b></font> is a "windowed" 
browser plugin that is launched from a web browser to display HDF4 and HDF5 
files. A <i><b>browser plugin</b></i> is a software program that extends the power 
of a web browser by adding more features and supporting more types of content 
than what the standard browser provides.

<p>
The HDF Web-browser plugin is <i><b>not HDFView</i></b>. HDFPlugin and HDFView are different 
software. HDFView is a Java-based standalone application that is used to view 
and edit HDF4 and HDF5 files and runs on multiple platforms. It has more browsing
features and edting features. The HDF Web-browser plugin is a "light" browser that
has less browsing features than HDFView. It has no editing features. For more
information on HDFView, visit: <a href="/hdf-java-html/">
/hdf-java-html/</a>

<p>
The HDF Web-browser plugin is <i><b> not an Applet</i></b>. Although both the
plug-in and applet are 
launched in a web browser, there is a major difference between the two. Like 
other software, a plug-in is downloaded and installed only once. It is installed 
onto local disk and launched from a local machine. Applets are downloaded at each 
invocation. 
<!--The advantage of network traffic of a plug-in over an applet is obvious.
-->
Following are the reasons for using a plug-in over an applet:
<OL>
<LI>An HDF applet must have a lot of GUI components, which will make the applet 
    "big".   Although applets can be cached, some users clean the cache 
     often for various reasons.
<P>
<LI>There is no pure Java implementation of the HDF library.  A dynamic 
    JNI library is built to bridge the Java and HDF C library.  There are 
    different dynamic link libraries for different platforms.  It will not 
    work well to use an applet. The applet will not be platform independent 
    because of the dynamic JNI library.

<h2>
About Current Release</h2>
It is a challenge to implement browser plugins. Plugins are platform and browser 
dependent. Each of these platform/browser combinations has its own requirements.
Furthermore, since Microsoft has removed support for Netscape plug-ins from IE 5.5 SP 2 
and beyond, plug-ins developed in Netscape Plugin APIs will not work on IE anymore. 
Netscape/Mozilla does not support ActiveX controls either. It is impossible to 
implement a single plugin to support all platform/browser combinations.

<p>
The current HDFPlugin is a <b>Windows only</b> application. It is implemented as an
<font color="#ff0000"><b>active document server </b></font>. An active document server
such as Microsoft Office Binder or Internet Explorer hosts documents of other application 
types called Active documents. An active document is a COM (Component Object Model) 
component that shows some data (charts, sheets, text documents, bitmaps) which is 
given by the Active Document Server.

<p>
HDFPlugin is an active document server. When you put an HDF file into Internet 
Explorer, the Internet Explorer (Container) calls HDFPlugin (Server or plugin)
to show HDF4 and HDF5 files. The HDFplugin can also run as a standalone application.
You can open HDF files directly from HDFPlugin. For more details, read the
