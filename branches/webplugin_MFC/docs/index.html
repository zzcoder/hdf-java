<font color="#FF0000"><b>HDF Web-browser plugin </b></font> is a windowed 
browser plugin that is launched from a web browser to display HDF4 and HDF5 
files. A <i><b>browser plugin</b></i> is a software program that extends the power 
of Web browser by adding more features and supporting more types of content 
than what the standard browser provides.

<p>
HDF Web-browser plugin is <i><b>not HDFView</i></b>. HDF Plug-in and HDFView are different 
software. HDFView is Java based standalone applcation that is used to view 
and edit HDF4 and HDF4 files and runs on multiple platforms. It has more browsing
features and edting features. HDF Web-browser plugin is "light" browser that
has less browsing features that HDFView. It has no editing feature. For more
information on HDFView, visit <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/">

<p>
HDF Web-browser plugin is <i><b> not an Applet</i></b>. Although both plug-in and applet are 
launched in web browser, there is a major difference between the two. Like 
other software, a plug-in is downloaded and installed only once. It is installed 
onto local disk and launched from local machine. Applets are downloaded at each 
invocation. The advantage of network traffic of a plug-in over an applet is obvious.

<h2>
About Current Release</h2>
It is a challenge to implement browser plugins. Plugins are platform and browser 
dependent. Each of these platform/browser combinations has its own requirements.
Furthermore, since Microsoft has removed support for Netscape plug-ins from IE 5.5 SP 2 
and beyond, plug-ins developed in Netscape Plugin APIs will not work on IE anymore. 
Netscape/Mozilla does not support ActiveX controls either. It is impossible to 
implement a single plugin to support all the platform/browser combinations.

<p>
The current HDFPlugin is <b>Windows only</b> application. It is implemented as an
<font color="#ff0000"><b>active document servers </b></font>. An active document server
such as Microsoft Office Binder or Internet Explorer hosts documents of other application 
types called Active documents. An active document is a COM (Component Object Model) 
component that shows some data (charts, sheets, text documents, bitmaps) which is 
given by Active Document Server.

<p>
The HDFPlugin is an active document server. When you put an HDF file into Internet 
Explorer, the Internet Explorer (Container) calls the HDFplugin (Server or plugin)
to show HDF4 and HDF5 files. The HDFplugin can also run as a standalone application.
You can open HDF files directly from HDFPlugin. For more details, read the
