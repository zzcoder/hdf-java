<h2>Mirador Data Access</h2>
Mirador is a new search and order Web interface being developed at the GES 
DISC for our data users. It has a drastically simplified, clean interface 
and employs the Google mini appliance for metadata keyword searches. Other 
features include quick response, data file hit estimator, Gazetteer (geographic 
search by feature name capability), and an interactive shopping cart.

<h2>LP DAAC Data Pool</h2>
The Data Pool is the publicly available portion of the LP DAAC online holdings. 
Data Pool provides a more direct way to access files by foregoing their retrieval 
from the nearline tape storage devices. All Data Pool holdings are available at 
no cost to the user.
