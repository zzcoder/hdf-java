<h2> <a name="ug04overview" id="ug04overview"></a>4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The Tree Viewer (or panel) shows the objects in each open file, and supports 
  the navigation and
  editing of those objects. Multiple files can be viewed and edited, and both
  HDF4 and HDF5 files can be opened. The viewing and editing operations work
  for both HDF4 and HDF5, although some operations cannot be implemented for
  HDF4.</p>
  
<p>Every HDF5 object appears in at least one group. A set of objects can be
stored together in a group. You can use the group object API functions
to create and manipulate the groups. With the groups, you can organize
the data objects in an HDF file. Objects in HDF4 may or may not belong to
a group. An object that does not belong to any group is called a lone object,
such as lone Vdata. To map HDF4 structure to HDF5 structure, a 
&ldquo;dummy&rdquo; root
group is created in the tree view and lone objects are put at the root group.</p>

<p>Since objects can have names in more than one group, the set of all
objects in an HDF file is a directed graph. It is difficult to manipulate
and browse the graph on a 2-D virtual screen. Instead of showing the directed
graph of the HDF file structure, HDFView displays HDF objects in a conventional
structure as a tree of &ldquo;folders,&rdquo; breaking the &ldquo;loops&rdquo; 
in the graph when 
necessary. The tree viewer of HDFView provides users an easy way to browse
and manage HDF data objects in an HDF file. The following icons are used to
represent HDF objects:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li2"><img src="images/icon_hdf4.gif"> --- HDF4 file</li>
<li class="li2"><img src="images/icon_hdf5.gif"> --- HDF5 file</li>
<li class="li2"><img src="images/icon_folderclose.gif"> --- Collapsed group folder</li>

</ul>
<br />

<h2>
4.2 Tree Structure</h2>
<p>
Upon opening an HDF file, HDFView displays the tree structure of the HDF
file in the tree viewer, which is the left panel in  the HDFView window. Every
HDF file has exactly one root group that is created when the file is created.
The root group is added to the root of the tree. When two or more files are
open, the root groups of the files are listed at the root in the tree view.</p>

<p>Groups are presented as folders in the tree viewer. Opening and closing
folders, you can browse the individual HDF objects in the HDF file. Datasets,
images and tables are leaf objects in the tree. Clicking a leaf object allows 
you to see the content of the object displayed in the data/document window
in the right panel of the HDFView window. </p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/tree_view.gif" />
<br />
<b>The tree viewer</b></p>
</center>

<p>
To select an object in the tree, point the mouse at the object and click once on the
object. You can open the data content of the selected data object from the menu bar
or from the popup menu.</p>

<p>The popup menu appears by clicking the right mouse button on the object
in the tree view. When a command is selected from the popup menu, the command
action will be taken on the object clicked.

<center>
<p><img src="images/menu_popup.gif" />
<br /><b>The object popup menu</b></p></center>

<h2>
<a name="ug04data"></a>4.3 View Data Content</h2>
<p>
The Tree View allows the user to navigate the structure of the HDF file,
to select individual objects, and to view the content of the selected object.</p>

<p>
You can open a data object in the tree by a double-mouse-click or selecting the 
&ldquo;Open&rdquo; command from the menu bar or the popup menu. By default, 
data content is displayed as an image, a table or text based on its datatype.  
See the following chapters for a detailed discussion of the data viewers.</p>

<p>
If the data value is not in memory, the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; action will load 
the data from the file and display it. If the data is already loaded into 
memory, it will just display the data. If you want to refresh data in memory 
or open a dataset with a different selection (subset or display option), 
you have to use the &ldquo;Open As&rdquo; command.</p>

<p>
Using &ldquo;Open As&rdquo;, you can select a subset of the dataset to 
display or change the default display options. For example, you can display 
the data values of an image in a spreadsheet, or show a scalar dataset 
as an image. For multi-dimension dataset, you can select any of two 
dimensions to display. The mouse-drag navigator allows you to select a 
subset by dragging the mouse over the preview image. For more details
about how to select a subset and dimensions, see 
<a href="ug05spreadsheet.html#ug05subset">5.2 Subset and Dimension Selection</a>.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Start&rdquo; field(s) determines the starting coordinate of 
the selected area.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;End&rdquo; field(s) determines the ending coordinate of the 
selected area.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Stride&rdquo; field(s) chooses array locations from the 
dataspace with each value in the stride array determining how many 
elements to move in each dimension. Setting a value in the stride array 
to 1 moves to each element in that dimension of the dataspace; setting a 
value of 2 in the stride array moves to every other element in that 
dimension of the dataspace. In other words, the stride determines the 
number of elements to move from the start location in each dimension. 
Stride values of 0 are not allowed. If the stride parameter is NULL, a contiguous
hyperslab is selected (as if each value in the stride array was set to 
all 1's).</p>

<h2>
<a name="ug04bitmask"></a>4.4 Show Bit Values</h2>

<p />
HDFVIew allows users to view bit values of 8-bit/16-bit integers in two ways: 
<ul>
	<li> applying a bitmask to data values </li>
	<li> showing values of selected bits</li>
</ul>

<p />
The figure below shows tha GUI layout of the two options:
<center>
</p><img src="images/bitmask_options.png" />
<br /><b>The bitmask options</b></p></center>
<p />
Applying a bitmask means to use the bitwise operation “AND” to the original data. For example,
<br /><img src="images/bitmask_and.png" />

<P />
Showing values of selected bits means to apply the bitmask to the data and throw 
away any unnecessary bits that are not selected by the bitmask, i.e. the “0” bits 
in the bitmask. In most of the cases, this will be the beginning and ending “0” bits 
in the bitmask. For example,  
<br /><img src="images/bitmask_extract.png" />
<p />
For the current implementation, only contiguous bits are allowed when the option of 
"Show Value of Selected Bits" is selected.
<p />

<h2>
<a name="ug04metadata"></a>4.5 Display Metadata and Attributes</h2>
<p>
The metadata dialog box appears by right-clicking the object (icon) in the tree 
or by selecting the &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; command from the 
&ldquo;Object&rdquo;
menu. The HDF metadata display contains two tabbed panes, showing the
general metadata and the user-defined attributes.</p>

<p>General metadata includes the name, type, and path of the data object.</p>

<p>For groups, general metadata also includes the name, type, and size of all
the members of the group. The following figure shows an example of the general 
information of a group.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/property_general_group.gif" />
<br />
<b>General properties of an HDF group</b></p>
</center>


<p>For a dataset (or image), the general metadata also includes the dataspace
information (rank, current, and maximum size of each dimension), datatype
information (type, size, and order).
The following figure shows an example of the metadata for a dataset.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/property_general_dataset.gif" />
<br />
<b>General properties of a dataset</b></p>
</center>

<p>
To see the attributes of an object, click the &ldquo;Attribute&rdquo; tab 
in the object's Properties window. The name, type, size, and value of all attributes
of the selected object are displayed in a table. The following figure shows an example
of the attribute display.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/property_attribute.gif" />
<br /><b>The Attributes tab</b></p></center>

<h2>
<a name="ug04edit"></a>4.6 Edit File and File Structure</h2>
<p>
The HDFView allows you to create and save a file and to add and delete objects in the
file. <b>Users should be aware that all the changes are made to the actual stored
file. This version does not support the undo operation; editing results cannot
be automatically recovered</b>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04file"></a>4.6.1 Create and Save File</h3>
<p>
The file creation dialog box appears when you choose the 
&ldquo;New HDF4/5&rdquo; command from the File menu. Choose the path and the 
file name you want to create and click the &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; button 
from the New File dialog box. A new file will be created with an empty root group.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_file.gif" />
<br /><b>Create New File</b></p></center>

<p>
Select &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; from the File menu to save the currently selected 
file into a new file of the same format, i.e. HDF4 to HDF4 or HDF5 to HDF5. 
(HDFView does not support HDF4 to HDF5 conversion.)</p>

<p>For HDF5, a new file is written that does not contain the inaccessible
objects, and it packs the unusable space. Thus, the new file may be smaller
than the original. <b>Dataset or attributes values that are object references
can not be updated.</b> For HDF4, a new file is the exact copy, same file
content and file size.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04libversion"></a>4.6.2 Setting the Library Version Bounds</h3>
<p>The library version bounds of an HDF5 file can be set by right click 
the file from treeview, and select &ldquo;Set Lib version bounds&rdquo; 
from the Object menu and set the earliest version and latest version. 
In order to see the library versions of the HDF5 File that had been set, 
select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; from the Object menu and it will display
the library versions that had been set earlier.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/set_libversionbounds.png" />
<br /><b>Setting the library version bounds of an HDF5 file</b></p></center>

<h3>
<a name="ug04add"></a>4.6.3 Add and Delete Object</h3>
<p>
To create a new group, select the &ldquo;New Group&rdquo; command from the 
Object menu. Then, give the name of the new group and the parent group to 
which the new group is to be added.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_group.png" />
<br /><b>The New Group dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>By clicking on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button, the user can set the 
options, creation order, and link storage when creating groups. Help buttons 
are provide for more information about the options.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_group_options.png" />
<br /><b>Create new group options</b></p></center>

<p>
To create a new dataset, select the &ldquo;New Dataset&rdquo; command from the 
Object menu. Then, specify the name, path, datatype, dataspace, and storage 
layout and compression of the new dataset. The current version only supports 
creating simple datatypes. This version cannot create an HDF4 VData or an HDF5 
compound dataset; however, these objects can be viewed. 
Supported datatypes include integers (byte, short, int, long), float, double, and
character. For HDF5, it also includes String and Object references.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_dataset.gif" />
<br /><b>The New Dataset dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The &ldquo;New Image&rdquo; command from the Object menu allows you to create 
an empty image with default image attributes. The new image does not have 
any palette attached to it. You can create two kinds of images: an indexed 
image with 256 colors and a 24-bit true color image.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_image.gif" />
<br /><b>The New HDF Image dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The &ldquo;New Link&rdquo; command from the object menu allows you to 
create links to objects. Three types of links can be created: 
hard, soft, or external. Hard links and soft links are links 
to objects in the same HDF5 file. External links are links to objects in a 
different HDF5 file. Soft links and external links are symbolic links and 
are allowed to dangle, meaning that the target object need not exist at 
the time the link is created. A Help button is provided for more information 
about links.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_link.png" />
<br /><b>The New Link dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The type for a soft link or external link object that links to a 
non-existing target object is unknown, so it will have a different 
icon as &lsquo;<img src="images/question.png" />&rsquo;
The user can change the target object being linked to, by slecting the 
link object from the tree view, right click and select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; 
from the object menu. In the Properties dialog box, select the 
&ldquo;Change&rdquo; button to change the target object.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/change_target.png" />
<br /><b>Change the target object for a dangling link</b></p></center>

<p>
To delete objects from the tree, you first select the objects, then choose the 
&ldquo;Delete&rdquo; command from the Object menu. A confirmation dialog 
appears to verify that you want to delete the selected objects.</p>
<p>
<b>Deleting an object from an HDF4 file is not supported</b>.
Deleting the HDF5 object calls the H5Gunlink() function of the HDF5 library. The unlink
function removes the link, and when an object has no remaining links, it can be deleted.
However, the HDF5 library does not currently reclaim the space in the file. This means
that the size of the file does not shrink even though objects are removed. (Users are
cautioned that repeatedly creating and deleting objects with HDFView can cause the HDF5
file to grow.) To get rid of the inaccessible objects, you have to save the current
file into a new file and rename the new file to the current file.</p>


<h3>
<a name="ug04copy"></a>4.6.4 Copy and Paste Object</h3>
<p>
HDFView allows you to copy an object and paste it in the same file or a different file
of the same type. To copy and paste an HDF5 object from the tree, select
the object and then select the &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command from the Object 
menu. You then select a group by a single click on the group to which the 
object is pasted. After you select the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command, the 
object is copied into the selected group. HDFView does not allow 
you to copy/paste an object of different format. The &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; 
command will create a new object in the selected group instead of 
making a hard link.</p>

<p>
You can also select multiple objects in the tree and apply the copy/paste action into
the selected objects. Selection can be contiguous and discontiguous. To make a
contiguous selection, hold down the Shift key and click on the first object, then
click on the second object while holding down the Shift key. All the objects between
the two objects will be selected inclusively. To make a discontiguous selection,
hold down the Ctrl key while clicking the objects with the left mouse button. The
objects being clicked will be selected. The rest of the operation of copying/pasting
multiple objects is the same as that of copying/pasting a single object.</p>

<p>
Copying a group will also copy all the descendents of the group. Copying a root
group is not allowed.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04move"></a>4.6.5 Move Object</h3>
<p>HDFView allows you to move an object within the same HDF5 file from 
one location to another. Moving objects from one file to another file is 
not supported by HDFView. To move an HDF5 object from the tree, select 
the object and then select the &ldquo;Cut&rdquo; command from the Object 
menu. You then select a group by a single click on the group to where the 
object is moved. Select the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command, the object is then 
moved into the selected group.</p>
<p>
You can also select multiple objects in the tree and apply the move action into
the selected objects. Selection can be contiguous and discontiguous.</p>
<p>
Moving a group will also move all the descendents of the group. Moving a root
group is not allowed. Moving objects is not supported by HDF4 Files.</p>


<h3>
<a name="ug04attribute"></a>4.6.6 Add, Delete and Modify Attribute</h3>
<p>
To add an attribute, click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button on the Attribute panel.
You can create an attribute of a string, scalar, and 1D array of simple datatypes.
Attributes of multiple dimensions or a compound datatype are not supported.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/new_attribute.gif" />
<br /><b>The New Attribute dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
To change the value of an attribute, type the new value into the cell. Only
string and scalar attributes can be modified. The new value must be interpretable
as a value of the correct type for the attribute. For a string value, the value
typed will be truncated to the size of the attribute if it is longer than the
declared size of the attribute. A valid data value must follow the rules specified
by the section <a href="ug05spreadsheet.html#ug05change">5.4 Change Data Value</a>.</p>

<p>
To change the name of an attribute, type the new name into the cell. Close the file and reopen it. Open the
attribute, the name will be the new name set. Note: once the attribute name is changed, it cannot be changed again until unless
the file is closed and reopened.</p>
<p>
To delete an attribute, select the attribute and click the &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; 
button. <b>Deleting an attribute of an HDF4 object is not supported</b>.</p>
